# Advanced Artificial Intelligence
This gives an introduction to artificial intelligence and then focuses on artificial intelligence as a central component within the data science. It presents and discusses how artificial intelligence relates to other areas within data science as, for example, data mining, information fusion, and decision support systems.
### Projects 
1. AI Ethics: Recent advancement and in artificial intelligence have a lot of ethical issues provided in military warfare and Cyber security warfare. The main challenges of artificial intelligence in warfare are meaningful human control. Fully Autonomous AI weapons will without the human intervention and control and make decisions, identify targets and take subsequent actions that humans can do (“Killer Robots and the Concept of Meaningful Human Control | Human Rights Watch,” 2016). Still many countries are discussing how to use autonomous weapons and human control is the burning issue and focal point for experts as well as countries (“Killer Robots and the Concept of Meaningful Human Control | Human Rights Watch,” 2016). 
In the present day there are no international treaties prohibiting the development and deployment of AI in war, which has given room for numerous countries to develop novel AI Lethal Autonomous weapons. The countries that are actively pursuing development of LAWs are China, USA, Russia and the United Kingdom. These countries raise a significant probability of LAWs being used in the future, which makes understanding the ethical and legal issues concerning AI in warfare (Umbrello, Torres, & De Bellis, 2020).
